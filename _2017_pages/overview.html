<h2>The meeting place for practitioners and researchers&nbsp;</h2>

<p>ICEM (<a href="http://www.icem.education" target="_blank">International Council of Educational Media</a>) is one of the oldest and more prominent associations in the field of technology-enhanced learning since 1950. The annual conference of ICEM travels around the world, bringing together both practitioners (teachers, publishers, software developers, service providers) and researchers from different continents. See the previous ICEM conferences at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icem.education/conferences/" target="_blank">http://www.icem.education/conferences</a>/</p>

<p>The ICEM 2018 conference will consist of three tracks: research track, practice track and educational media industry fair.&nbsp;<br><br>&#8203;As a special feature, the Tallinn conference provides to participants an opportunity to visit Estonian schools and educational media companies (incl. the hottest startups). You knew that Skype was made in Estonia, right?&nbsp;</p>
